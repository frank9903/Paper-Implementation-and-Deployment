# Paper-Implementation-and-Deployment
Build, train and deploy papers
## Introduction
This repo is not meant to exactly reproduce the paper results but instead, what I want to achieve is to understand and visualize paper models without tedious environment setups. To do so, I'm going to build, train and validate the models all in __Google Colab__. On top of that, this repo will also focus on various ways of deploying the models (for iOS), including but not limited to:
1. Use local server and HTTP request
2. Convert Pytorch model to CoreML model
3. Convert Keras/TensorFlow model to CoreML model
